# A simple C++ Interpreter

**DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION.**

Really, it is just dead simple. 

It doesn't do type checking at the moment (most types are ignored), there isn't a semantic analyzer yet (it used to but I had to remove it due to source code size limit of the task) and many features are not supported (classes are not supported, and I/O stuffs are all hardcoded).
